### What happens when I downgrade my plan?

On downgrading the plan from Team/ Business/ Enterprise to free version, you will have some limits around the usage of Postman features such as collaboration, SSO and others. Please refer to the below link to know the complete comparison of our plan features.

All your data should remain synced to your account and the same can be checked by navigating to the web dashboard from the link below:

*   Web-dashboard: [https://go.postman.co/me/collections](https://go.postman.co/me/collections)

**What happens upon cancellation?**  

1.  **Enterprise to Business:** All of the data remains intact, Reduction in the number of monitor and API calls, No reporting feature and Custom EULA, Payment options.  
      
    
2.  **Business to Team:** All of the data remains intact, No roles and permissions on collections, private workspace, and SSO, Payment options.  
      
    
3.  **Any plan to Free version:** If there are above 25 requests in Team workspace then the collections longest without a revision will be archived in order. 

Upgrading the plan to Team/ Business/ Enterprise will uplift the restrictions and the collections will be unarchived back to the respective Team workspaces.
