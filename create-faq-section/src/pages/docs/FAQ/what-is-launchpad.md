### What is Launchpad?

With the latest application update, we have come up with a **launchpad** feature that lets beginners know the options available within the application and the existing users can also explore the hidden features or the features that they haven’t tried out yet.

The functions on the display are simple to work with and you will find the different features present in one place. This makes it easier for users to explore features easily. It would be a one-click action to find out the different options rather than looking for a feature the standard way.

**Start Launchpad:** New users can see this feature as soon as they open the application. The existing Postman users need to close all the tabs to get this option.

Users can click on “**Open Launchpad”** as shown below:

LaunchPad provides a clear indication on how to proceed further, especially if you're a first time user, it provides an index to start running the First request, Collection or an Environment. 

 It also has some General settings to customize the application such as modes or pane view.

 **Work smarter with Postman** section enables you to know the features provided by Postman which includes the Bootcamp sessions that let the users learn about the common features such as Monitors, Documentation, Design and Mock Apis, Debugging and Manual or automated testing and others.

The section **“Discover”** lets users navigate to the various Templates and APIs which might be helpful.![Screenshot_2019-10-03_at_3.56.07_PM.png](https://support.getpostman.com/hc/article_attachments/360048281333/Screenshot_2019-10-03_at_3.56.07_PM.png)

For existing users, the launchpad additionally provides an insight of the existing Team workspaces users can join and collaborate, it also shows their recent workspaces they were working or building a collection on.
